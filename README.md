# Voting App

Simple Voting App running on client side with webpack bundle script. Thanks to @dappuniversity.

### Interacting

[VOTING WEBSITE](https://dapps.neocities.org/voting/index.html)

Make sure your browser has metamask installed. If not, visit [metamask](https://metamask.io/) and create a new account.

Then, go to [Rinkeby's faucet](https://faucet.rinkeby.io/). Here you will need to use one of your social networks to claim some testnet ether (up to 18.5) per social link. Follow instructions in the website.

Return to voting website, select your candidate, and click on "Vote". Metamask should pop a window and ask you to sign the transaction.

### Checking with Etherscan

I have deployed an example to Rinkeby Testnet with the following address: 0x588b535bc6574895c7e8BBA7a59Bb58a8aec5444

[check with etherscan](https://rinkeby.etherscan.io/address/0x588b535bc6574895c7e8BBA7a59Bb58a8aec5444)

You can also see all events emitted by the contract in the 'events' tab on etherscan.
